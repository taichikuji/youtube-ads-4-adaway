# PS Script to transform the ready-made lists for Pihole to work on Adaway

## Before using, you have two ways of using this;
```Download the list directly from this repo and install it on your Adaway app```

## The second option is to use the script to transform the list directly
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taichikuji/youTube-ads-4-adaway/master/adaway_script.ps1
# How the script works
- It downloads the list to whatever folder you have the script in
- It will apply the changes that it requires to work on adaway
- After downloading, it removes the original list file and just leaves the modified version

### Unlike the OG repo, this doesn't say that it updates daily when it really doesn't... However i'll try to keep it active! The script should always work as long as the main repo is still up and running.
